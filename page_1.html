 Astro is a robot boy. He was made by Ochanomizu at the Ministry
  of science. He is different from normal robots in that he has 
  Kokoro(Kokoro means he can feel, develop his own thoughts, 
  feelings and has a mind of his own). Astro learns at an 
  exponential rate, which means he soaks knowledge up like a
   sponge, this also means he needs to be taught lessons very 
   often by his nanny named Nora. As Astro learns more and more
    about his robot body the more features and powers he figures 
    out and discovers. The whole metro city (where astro lives)
     knows the wonders of the robot boy. But something is always 
     off about Ochanomizu; he is always surprised when Astro gets
      a new ability and when the public asks Dr. Ochanomizu about
       how astro works, how he gets all his powers and, if there 
       are any more powers that he can unlock...
