Lull in the sea is a story of Hikari, Manaka, Chisaki, and Kaname. Friends since they were toddlers live in the sea with their species who are humans who can live and breath underwater and swim and fast rates. The only reason they can breath underwater and swim super fast is because of a special skin layer called ena that is over their regular skin that sometimes glimmers in the sunlight at just the right lighting when they're on land. The downside of ena is because it can help you breath in the sea when you’re on land without any water for your ena too long it dries up and anyone with ena could potentially die...
