  My Hero Academia is the story of a boy named Izuku Midoriya 
  (nickname deku, the word deku referred to a certain doll with 
  no arms or legs and used as an insult meaning someone is 
  useless). In the TV show we can see Deku being a kind and 
  loving boy with such a bright POV of the world, filled with
  rainbows and cupcakes. Altho he centered his life around one 
  thing in life being a superhero. In the world deku lives in 
  anyone with what is called a ‘quirk’ can be a hero. A quirk is 
  a superhero that people are inborn with 80% of the population 
  was born with there weren't a lot of options for people who had
  a weak quirk or were quirkless, but despite being quirkless 
  Deku looked up to all sorts of heroes all with a different 
  kind of different powers.The one he specifically looks up to 
  is a hero named All Might the #1 ranked hero in the world.
  Deku wants to hopefully be #2 ranked hero with his best
  friend ‘kacchan’ being #1 hero. Kacchan (or his real name
  Katsuki) isn't really the nicest person in the My Hero
  Academia world and isn't the best to deku (kacchan
  the one who gave izuku the nickname) when deku told 
  kacchan that he was quirkless in just grade school, at 
  first kacchan told him that deku would be the first 
  quirkless hero. That’s why deku stayed friends with 
  kacchan, because kacchan at the time believed that
  deku could be a hero, but when middle school hit 
  kacchan knew deku could never be a hero. Therefore saw 
  deku as his nickname stands by a good for nothing object 
  in the way of his future of his hero career...
