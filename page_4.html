Promised neverland is about a story of kids ranging from 11 years old- just barely newborns and toddlers. Emma is one of the main character along with her two really close friends Ray and Norman are the oldest kids in the orphanage. From the very start we see that everyone in the orphanage has an ID number on all their necks even the caretaker Yukko. She’s the “mother” of the kids in the orphanage. The kids all have these certain clothes that are white and for the boys cover their whole arms and legs, for the girls they have the same types of tops, but instead of pants they have skirts. We also see that they get tested with scanning barcodes and such and all the kids 6-11 years old take this test. Emma, her friends and the rest of the kids in the orphanage are all told when they turn 12, they will be adopted if they’re not adopted at six. All the kids that leave the orphanage the home they grew up in say they will write to their beloved siblings but once they leave they never hear from those kids again….
